Version 1.2

 - Added an bonus GetObjectsInFrustumFast() method which uses the native sphere_is_visible() function added in 2024.1400 betas
    - In my testing it runs in about half the time as the original
    - This might become the default version eventually, unless I find something wrong with it

Version 1.1

 - A bunch of optimizations
 - A whole bunch of new `Vector` functions (including a Vector2 class), just for fun
 - Removed the Matrix classes in favor of just using the GameMaker 16-element array matrices, because those were confusing and using them added more overhead that I really like
 - If you construct a ColTransformedModel (or call the Set() method that goes with them) with an array of ColTriangles instead of a ColMesh, a ColMesh will be created for you
	 - This will create a new ColMesh from scratch, so only do this if each Transformed Model is to be associated with a unique Mesh
 - ColWorld now takes an Octree, **Quadtree**, or _Spatial Hash_ as its preferred acceleration structure instead of creating one for you
 - ColWorld::CheckRay can now take a maximum distance, discarding any hits that are farther away
 - Added `COL_MIN_TREE_DENSITY` to set the object threshold for when a tree structure is subdivided, which can speed them up by a fair amount
 - Shapes attached to objects also have an .object reference that they can refer back to
